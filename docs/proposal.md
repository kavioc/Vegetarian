## Summary of the Project

Our project is to simulate a set of reward policies in Minecraft. We will create platforms with different sizes and shapes to allow the agent to walk different paths from start （emerald_block）to end（redstone_block）. We will place different foods in some diamond_blocks. Each different food will represent a reward or punishment score（negative rewards）. The agent can move in four different directions and each step is 1 block. Each movement consumes a certain score value. Our goal is to let the agent find the optimal path through the learning of the environment, which means that the agent needs to get the highest score in a limited number of steps as much as possible.

***Input:***
The state of the agent, such as, the coordinates or the current rewards. 

***Output:***
An agent need to take actions, such as, moving directions, picking up foods, or changing rewards.

## AI/ML Algorithms 
 
- Dynamic Programming
- Deep Q-Learning (Reinforcement Learning)
- Greedy Algorithm
- More on later

Currently, our project plan to use Dynamic Programming and Deep Q-Learning (Reinforcement Learning) to record agent scores after taking different actions. We plan to use Greedy Algorithm to optimize the agent. Definitively, Malmos API’s depth map functionality will be used when process the image. We may add more algorithms in the implementation process, which will be updated in our future discussions.
